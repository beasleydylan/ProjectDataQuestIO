# ProjectDataQuestIO
Collection of projects I have completed from DataQuest.
This project was the first one I have completed within the Dataquest course. It is quite simple show how I utilize simple data formatting tool in order to determine what
type of application I want to create within a fictional company. I compared genres, ratings, etc with application from both the google and app play store in order to 
reach this determination.
